a.        The basic BACT criteria for all new valves in VOC service are to be of a leakless type (e.g. bellows seal type)\, except those specifically exempted under SCAQMD Rule 1173(l) or as approved by SCAQMD in the following applications. \\
\\
b.         BSV Exemption List \\
\\
1. Valves in heavy liquid service (i.e. streams with a vapor pressure < 0.1 psia @ 100 ºF (kerosene) based on the most volatile class present >20% by volume) \\
\\
2. Control valves \\
\\
3. Instrument tubing application (including instrument root valves) - Sealed bellows valves are not required for instrument valves\, including root valves on instrumentation. Instrument root valves include vessel bridle valves\, orifice tap root valves\, pressure tap root valves and analyzer tap root valves. Gauge glass\, level transmitter and level switch connections to the bridle\, and instrument vents and drains do not require sealed bellows valves. Valves in level drain lines piped to a slop oils or other collection system do not require sealed bellows valves. Sample Connections - Treat the same way as instrument valves. \\
\\
4. Applications requiring torsional valve stem motion (i.e. 90º - turn valves\, such as butterfly\, ball and plug valves). Examples include but are not limited to:A. Throttling - Process lines that may require throttling such as bypass loops and feed lines.B. Quick Action - Hydraulic Systems; Systems such as dryers which require quick action to accomplish switching between regeneration and drying cycles.C. LPG and Low Temperature ServicesD. Amine\, H2S\, HF\, and H2SO4 containing systemsE. Tight shut-offF. Low Pressure drop \\
\\
5. Applications where valve failure could pose a safety hazard (e.g.  with valve stem in horizontal position). \\
\\
6. Retrofit/special applications with space limitations (special applications such as skid mounted standard packaged systems). \\
\\
7. Valves not commercially available. \\
\\
8. Components exclusively handling commercial natural gas. \\
\\
9. Components exclusively handling fluids with a VOC concentration of ten percent by weight or less\, determined according to test methods specified in Rule 1173(j)(2). \\
\\
10. Components incorporated in lines while operating under negative pressure. \\
\\
11. Lubricating fluids. \\
\\
12. Components buried below ground. \\
\\
13. Pressure vacuum valves on storage tanks. \\
\\
\\
c.        All new process components that will be installed as part of the proposed project will be required to fully comply with the accepted BACT guidelines. Replaced in kind valves that will continue to operate in same service are exempt from BACT requirements. \\
\\
d.        For the purpose of this document commercially available BSV valves are items that are usually part of stock on hand at the warehouse of the supplier or manufacturer. The valves are listed in a manufacturer's published catalog and are not considered to be a special order item because of trim or metallurgy. The delivery time is typical for items in stock at the warehouse not including time.\\
\\
e.        Bellows sealed valve with 321 stainless steel bellows material is normally required. For services that may cause 321 stainless bellows to crack (i.e.\, chloride stress cracking)\, Inconel 625 bellows material shall be used. Chloride stress cracking may occur at continuous operating temperatures between 150F to 350F. The operating units where chloride stress cracking is likely to occur are the crude and reformer units.\\
\\
9.1.11 Block Valves for Pressure Instruments\\
\\
The block valve for pressure instrument shall be a piping primary block valve. \\

\\
Critical areas of valve bodies and bonnets in hydrogen service in ASME class 600 and higher shall be radiographed (if made of castings ) or ultrasonically examined (if made of forgings) as specified in the Valve Specification Sheets (Standard 205V).\\
 \\

The V-Numbers for these valves are V01890 (Class 150\, 316SS trim)\, V01891 (Class 150\, Alloy 20 Trim)\, V03890 (Class 300\, 316SS trim)\, and V03891 (Class 300\, Alloy 20 trim). The valves with 316SS trim can be used for line classes where 12 chrome trim or 316SS trim have been specifed\, and the valves with Alloy 20 trim can be used in line classes CAE and DAE. Consult Engineering for other service requirements. \\
\\
9.1.14 Motor Operated Valves\\
\\
Gate valves shall be investigated for the need to have a motor operator in sizes 24\" and larger. Frequency and speed of operation shall be considered.\\
\\
9.1.15 Torque Handle Operated Ball Valves (Deadman Valves)\\
\\

16,16.0 Piping Material Classification Index         ,This specification contains a PIPING MATERIAL CLASSIFICATION INDEX\, which is a summary of the information in each line class.  It can be used as a quick reference or to compare line classes.  The Index may be found following this introductory section.\\
\\
A few line classes have been placed on the ARCHIVE LIST and shown on the chart following the Piping Material Classification Index.  The chart also shows the new equivalent line class to use.  The archived line classes are not part of this specification.,SILVERM3,2008-4-5

18,18.0 Valves and V-Sheets                          ,The following valve specification sheets are used to purchase valves that are specified in the individual Piping Material Line Classes. Refer to the appropriate line class to determine which valve specification sheet to use. \\
The valve specification sheets (V-Sheets) provide an outline of the general characteristics for each specific type of valve\, and assign each valve a unique valve number. The sheets provide the applicable manufacturing standard\, the metallurgy of the valve parts\, pressure rating\, end connections\, and the required non-destructive examination\, if applicable. See the VALVE NUMBER INDEX for the list of approved manufacturers and figure numbers of acceptable valves. \\
The following example is offered as a guideline in ordering valves from the sheets:\\
\\
Refer to the P&ID's or piping isometric drawings to determine the applicable piping line class. For this example\, line class \"CA\" is selected. The valve size and type to be considered is a 4\" gate valve. Referring to line class \"CA\"\, this valve has a valve number of \"V01010.\" Find this valve with this number in the valve specification sheets. Use this sheet to purchase the valve. \\
\\
In general\, the more unique the valve the more information is required to describe it. However\, in most cases\, the specification sheet provides sufficient detail to describe the valve to a vendor. \\
\\
Refer to Section 15 for valve stem packing requirements. \\
\\
A valve number system is defined such that the valves are listed numerically by category. They are listed by ASME class rating (designated 01 for class 150\, 03 for class 300\, etc.)\, followed by a three digit number indicating the specific type of valve. The following is a breakdown of the valve number and the three digit designator for a class 600 gate valve.\\
