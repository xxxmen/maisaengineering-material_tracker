The bypass valve shall be globe type, and shall be sized in accordance with the following, unless otherwise specified on the P&ID.          MAIN VALVE                  BY-PASS VALVE          4"" -  8""                                      3/4""         10"" - 14""                                   1""         16"" and larger                           1 1/2""  9.1.9   Sample connections shall have a primary block valve at the main line or equipment per the  applicable line class. The sampling valve shall be a needle or ball valve per the applicable secondary instrument piping line class.  9.1.10        Bellows-Sealed Valves Applications (for LAR only)          a. Bellows-sealed gate and globe valves shall be used in sizes 2"" and smaller in light             hydrocarbon liquid, gas and vapor services. An approximate definition of light hydrocarbon             liquid service is any liquid having a vapor pressure greater than that of kerosine, i.e. >0.10             psig @ 100F. Complete definitions of light hydrocarbon liquid service follows:          1) Per EPA NSPS, Subpart GGG, Section 60.593 (d), equipment is in light liquid service if             the percent evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150C (302F) as determined by ASTM             D-86.          2) In SCAQMD Rule 1173, components handling liquids exclusively, if the weight percent             evaporated is 10 percent or less at 150C as determined by ASTM Method D-86, are exempt,              (i.e. they are not in light liquid service).          3) EPA  NSPS, Subpart VV, Section 60.485 (e) may also be used to define light service. This            requires that the fluid is a liquid at operating conditions and the total concentration of the            pure components having a vapor pressure greater than 0.3 kilopascals absolute (0.04 psia)            at 20C is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight. Standard reference texts or ASTM            D-2879 shall be used to determine the vapor pressure of components.          b.  Bellows-sealed valves need not be used in the following applications:                  1)  Heavy hydrocarbon liquids                  2)  Control valves                  3)  Instrument piping and tubing, including root valves 1/2"" and smaller.                  4)  Valve replacements where space would be limiting and re-piping would be required.                  5)  Valves in which valve stem motion would impose a torsional loading on the bellows                      (ball valves) which cannot be replaced with gate or globe valves.                  6)  Liquid drain valves in which the valve stem must be in the horizontal position and                      cannot be taken out of service without a shutdown.  9.1.11    BLOCK VALVES FOR PRESSURE INSTRUMENTS               The block valve for pressure instrument shall be a Gauge Valve for the Cherry Point refinery (see standard drawing no. APCO-DWG-P-38 in Engineering Standard 202) and a piping primary block valve for the Los Angeles refinery.  9.1.12    VALVES IN HYDROGEN SERVICE               Critical areas of valve bodies and bonnets in hydrogen service in ASME class 600 and higher shall be radiographed (if made of castings ) or ultrasonically examined (if made of forgings) as specified in the Valve Specification Sheets (Standard  205V).  9.2        PIPE  9.2.1     Where calculated wall thickness is specified in the individual line classes, it shall be calculated in accordance with ASME B31.3 or ASME B31.1, latest edition, as applicable.  Refer to the D/t criterion specified in Paragraph 5.2 of this specification.  9.2.2     Straight-run piping 1 1/2"" and smaller in socketweld classes, shall be joined by socketwelding the ends together with a coupling; for piping in threaded classes, use threaded coupling.  9.2.3     Pipe 2"" and larger for field fabrication shall be purchased in double random lengths.  Piping 1 1/2"" and smaller shall be purchased in single random lengths.  9.2.4     Welded pipe shall not be substituted for seamless pipe without prior ARCO Engineering Services approval.  9.3        FITTINGS  9.3.1     When buttwelding fitting wall thickness is specified to match pipe, fittings of commercially available wall thickness shall be used even though wall thickness of such fittings may be slightly heavier then the pipe.  Taper bore ends of fittings internally if thickness exceeds that of the pipe by more than 1/16"".  Taper boring shall not result in infringement of the minimum wall thickness.  9.3.2     Mitered elbows are not permitted unless prior written approval has been obtained from ARCO.  9.3.3     Long radius elbows shall be used except when impractical due to space limitations.  9.3.4     When using short radius elbows per ASME B16.28, note that pressure ratings of these elbows             are 80% to that of  equivalent pipe.  9.4        FLANGES  9.4.1      Weld neck flanges are specified with bore to match mating buttweld fittings or pipe.  9.4.2      Weld neck orifice flanges are specified with bore to match mating pipe (taper boring is not               permitted).  9.4.3      Large diameter flanges (26"" and larger) shall be investigated so that flange drilling matches              the flange on the equipment.  9.4.4      Use steel flat face flanges and full face gaskets against cast iron flanged valves and quipment              (does not apply to Ductile Iron).  9.4.5      Orifice flanges shall be ordered in pairs with jack screws but without bolting or gaskets.  9.4.6      Dimensions of blind flanges 26""  nominal size and larger shall assure capability of sustaining              full hydrostatic pressure test for the specified ASME pressure class.

The Index may be found following this introductory section.  Most of the line classes are common to both the Cherry Point Refinery (CPR) and the Los Angeles Refinery (LAR). There are, however, a few line classes that are applicable only to one of the refineries and these are indicated under the ""COMMENT"" column.  A few line classes have been placed on the ARCHIVE LIST and shown on the chart following the Piping Material Classification Index.  The chart also shows the new equivalent line class to use.

19,99,99.0 Foreword                                     ,"                                                                 FOREWORD  The following valve specification sheets are used to purchase the valves that are specified in the individual Piping Material Line Classes.  Refer to the appropriate line class to determine which valve specification sheet to use.  The valve specification sheets provide an outline of the general characteristics for each specific type of valve, and assign each valve a unique valve number.  The sheets provide the applicable manufacturing standard, the metallurgy of the valve parts, pressure rating, end connections, and the required non-destructive examination, if applicable. See the VALVE NUMBER INDEX for the list of approved  manufacturers and figure numbers of acceptable valves.   The following example is offered as a guideline in ordering valves from the sheets:      Refer to the P&ID's or piping isometric drawings to determine the applicable     piping line class.  For this example, line class ""CA"" is selected.  The valve size     and type to be considered is a 4"" gate valve.  Referring to line class ""CA"", this     valve has a valve number of ""V01010.""  Find this valve with this number in the     valve specification sheets. Use this sheet to purchase the valve.  In general, the more unique the valve the more information is required to describe it.  However, in most cases, the specification sheet provides sufficient detail to describe the valve to a vendor.  Refer to ARCO Engineering Standard 205 for valve stem packing requirements.  A valve number system is defined such that the valves are listed numerically by category.  They are listed by ASME class rating (designated 01 for class 150, 03 for class 300, etc.), followed by a three digit number indicating the specific type of valve.  The following is a breakdown of the valve number and the three digit designator for a class 600 gate valve.
