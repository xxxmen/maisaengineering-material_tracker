""Hydrogen Service"" is defined as any fluid stream containing 50 PSIA or greater partial pressure of hydrogen.  4.5        ""Sour Water Service"" is defined as a fluid stream containing liquid water and at least 50 PPM by weight of hydrogen sulfide, with or without ammonia.  4.6        ""Wet Sour Gas Service"" is defined as a fluid stream containing water and gas at a total pressure of 65 PSIA or greater and partial pressure of hydrogen sulfide is greater than 0.05 PSIA at a temperature of 250F or less, with no amine present.  4.7        ""Acid Gas"" is defined as a fluid stream containing high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide with water present, typically overhead streams from an amine regenerator.  4.8        ""Amines"" are defined as organic alkanolamine solutions, typically 15-30%, used to remove acid gases (CO2, H2S) from refinery process gas streams. They include DEA, MEA, MDEA, DGA,  and DIPA.  4.9        Lines in ""Sour Water and Wet Sour Gas"" services shall meet the requirements of NACE Standard MR0103 latest edition.

18,18.0 Flange Electrical Isolation                  ,"18.1     Isolate Above & Below Ground Piping  18.1.1     Flange isolation kits shall be installed wherever underground and aboveground metal piping systems are connected together.  The isolation kit shall be installed aboveground at a flange connection near the point where the pipe emerges from the ground.  The location shall provide easy access for maintenance.  When an aboveground block valve is installed at or near the isolation kit location, the kit shall be located on the process unit side of the valve, or whichever side of the valve is more readily depressured and drained for kit maintenance.    18.1.2     The purpose of the isolation kit is to minimize corrosion of the underground piping by electrical isolation at the flange, which prevents the underground piping from becoming a sacrificial anode for the aboveground piping.  18.1.3     Cooling Water, Fire Water, and Utility Water systems are examples of services where this application of isolation kits is common.  18.2     Isolate Dissimilar Metal Piping & Equipment  18.2.1     When dissimilar metals are connected together, regardless of whether it is above or below ground, such as a flange set connecting two pipe classes of different metallurgy or connecting piping and equipment of different metallurgy, there is the potential for galvanic activity between the different materials, which may result in corrosion.  The potential for corrosion is dependent on the combination of materials involved and the ratio of the areas of the two materials for the specific installation.  Isolation kits are not needed where there is no aqueous phase at the junction between the two materials.  There is not a simple method to determine when an isolation kit is required for dissimilar metal cases.  Consult the Refinery Corrosion Engineer to determine if an isolation kit is required.  18.2.2     One example of this application of isolation kits is the connection between the carbon steel piping and titanium air cooler bundles in the Sour Water Treating Area of Unit 17.  18.3     Location & Identification of Isolation Kits  18.3.1     All isolation kits shall be shown on the applicable P&ID and piping drawings, and shall be identified by a Specialty Item Number (SP#) assigned by the Cherry Point Document Control Department.  A request form shall be filled out by project personnel and submitted to Document Control for all SP# assignments.  18.3.2     The SP# request form shall include a detailed description suitable for purchasing the isolation kit, including flange size, flange type, pressure class, materials, and any other special criteria.  If applicable, also include the storehouse stock number in the description.  18.4     Isolation Kit Specifications For RF & FF Flanges At Maximum 392°F Temperature   18.4.1     Service for the isolation kits specified here shall be limited as follows. The kits are rated for design temperatures up to 392°F, limited by the G-3 Phenolic washers.  Do not use where steam-out temperature exceeds 392°F.  Do not use for Caustic service greater than 30% concentration.  For locations with upstream chemical injection, consult with the Refinery Corrosion Engineer to verify isolation kit material compatibility with the injected chemical.  18.4.2     The requisitioner shall specify the flange size, flange type (Slip-On or Weld Neck), and pressure class.  For the unusual case of a flange set with a Slip-On flange mated to a Weld Neck flange, which may occur at a pipe class break point, the isolation kit shall be sized for the Weld Neck flange, based on it having the smaller inside diameter.  18.4.3     Gaskets shall be 1/8"" thick, full face (Type E), biaxially orientated PTFE reinforced with silica, Flexitallic Sigma 511.  Gasket I.D. shall be 1/8"" smaller than flange I.D..  Dielectric Strength shall be a minimum of 350 Volts/Mil.  18.4.4     Bolt Sleeves shall be 1/32"" thick, Nomex, full length (extending half way into steel washers on both ends), with diameter corresponding to bolt size as required by flange.  Quantity of sleeves shall match the number of flange bolts.  18.4.5     Washers shall be 1/8"" thick, double washer sets, with G-3 Hi-Temp Phenolic isolating washers and plated hot-rolled steel back-up washers.  Washers shall be sized with I.D. to fit over the bolt sleeves, and with O.D. to fit within the bolt facings of standard ASME flanges.  Quantity of washer sets shall match the number of flange bolts.  18.4.6     Bolt lubricant shall be non-conductive anti-seize lubricant, Kleen-Seize or approved equal.  This is available in the Storehouse as stock #2845004450.  18.4.7     The manufacturer's instructions shall be followed for installation of each isolation kit.

Refer to the appropriate line class to determine which valve specification sheet to use.  The valve specification sheets provide an outline of the general characteristics for each specific type of valve, and assign each valve a unique valve number.  The sheets provide the applicable manufacturing standard, the metallurgy of the valve parts, pressure rating, end connections, and the required non-destructive examination, if applicable. See the VALVE NUMBER INDEX for the list of approved  manufacturers and figure numbers of acceptable valves.   The following example is offered as a guideline in ordering valves from the sheets:      Refer to the P&ID's or piping isometric drawings to determine the applicable     piping line class.  For this example, line class ""CA"" is selected.  The valve size     and type to be considered is a 4"" gate valve.  Referring to line class ""CA"", this     valve has a valve number of ""V01010.""  Find this valve with this number in the     valve specification sheets. Use this sheet to purchase the valve.  In general, the more unique the valve the more information is required to describe it.  However, in most cases, the specification sheet provides sufficient detail to describe the valve to a vendor.  Refer to BPCP Engineering Standard 205 for valve stem packing requirements.  A valve number system is defined such that the valves are listed numerically by category.  They are listed by ASME class rating (designated 01 for class 150, 03 for class 300, etc.), followed by a three digit number indicating the specific type of valve.  The following is a breakdown of the valve number and the three digit designator for a class 600 gate valve.
