THIS PIPE CLASS ""A2A"" WAS DEVELOPED TO REPLACE AND TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED WITH CLASS ""A"" & ""A2"", WHICH HAVE BEEN ARCHIVED.  BE AWARE THAT THE EXISTING SEWER SYSTEMS MAY INCLUDE MANY DIFFERENT MATERIAL COMBINATIONS AS INDICATED IN THESE SPECIAL NOTES. CLASS ""A2A"" SHOULD BE USED FOR REPAIRS TO EXISTING PIPING SYSTEMS BUILT TO CLASS ""A"" & ""A2"", INCLUDING MINOR REPAIRS TO ORIGINAL SANITARY SEWER PIPING.  B.  PIPE CLASS ""A2A"" SHALL NOT BE USED FOR NEW SANITARY SEWER WORK. NEW INSTALLATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THE SANITARY SEWERS SHALL BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH BIRCH BAY WATER & SEWER DISTRICT (BBWSD) STANDARDS, AND REQUIRES DESIGN APPROVAL AND CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION BY BBWSD. SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REPAIRS SHALL ALSO BE REVIEWED WITH BBWSD. REFER TO BBWSD PROJECT & SERVICES AGREEMENT MARCH 12, 2002, PARAGRAPH 22.4 FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS & MODIFICATIONS.  CONTACT BBWSD PRIOR TO START OF DESIGN OR CONSTRUCTION.    C.  CLASS ""A"" ORIGINALLY INCLUDED OILY WATER, CLEAN WATER & SANITARY SEWERS, AND WAS CONSTRUCTED OF XH C.I. PIPING UP TO 10"" SIZE, AND REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPING FOR 12"" & LARGER SIZES.  GASKETS WERE NEOPRENE.  IN 1985 THE SPECIFICATION FOR C.I. PIPE WAS REVISED TO SERVICE WEIGHT BECAUSE XH WAS NOT AVAILABLE.  IN 1998 AT THE REQUEST OF THE CARSON REFINERY THE C.I. PIPE WAS REPLACED WITH DUCTILE IRON PIPE WITH RESTRAINED PUSH-ON JOINTS.  ALSO ADDITIONAL FACTORY HYDROTESTING REQUIREMENTS WERE ADDED FOR REINFORCED CONCRETE PIPE DUE TO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THROUGH-WALL LEAKAGE DURING FIELD HYDROTESTING.  GASKETS WERE REVISED FROM NEOPRENE TO SBR AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME.  IN 2002 GASKETS WERE AGAIN REVISED TO NBR (NITRILE) BECAUSE IT IS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH HYDROCARBONS.  ALSO IN 2002, THE SERVICE FOR CLASS ""A"" WAS CHANGED TO CLEAN WATER SEWERS ONLY, BECAUSE ""A2"" WAS GENERATED FOR OILY WATER SEWERS, AND SANITARY SEWERS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH BBWSD STANDARDS.    D.  CLASS ""A2"" WAS GENERATED BY THE ISOM PROJECT AS A REPLACEMENT PIPE CLASS FOR OILY WATER SEWER. IT SPECIFIED ALL D.I. PIPING WITH U.S. PIPE TR-FLEX RESTRAINED JOINTS AND WITH VITON GASKETS. AFTER FIELD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SYSTEM, THE FIELD CONTRACTORS INDICATED THAT THE FITTINGS AND JOINTS WERE DIFFICULT TO INSTALL DUE TO SIZE, WEIGHT, AND COMPLEXITY.  ALSO WITH THE D.I. FITTINGS IT WAS HARD TO MAKE DIRECTIONAL CHANGES IN TIGHT AREAS, AND THERE WAS NO EASY WAY TO INSTALL P-TRAPS.            E.  ALL 10"" & SMALLER GRAVITY SEWER LINES INSTALLED DURING ORIGINAL REFINERY CONSTRUCTION AND UP UNTIL 1985 SHOULD BE XH CAST IRON.  FROM 1985 UNTIL 2004, SERVICE WEIGHT C.I. PIPE WAS SPECIFIED BECAUSE A SUPPLIER FOR XH WEIGHT COULD NOT BE FOUND.  IN 2004 A SUPPLIER OF XH C.I. PIPE WAS AGAIN LOCATED AND THE SPECIFICATION WAS CHANGED BACK TO XH WEIGHT.  BEFORE ORDERING MATERIALS FOR REPAIRS, TIE-INS, OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING C.I. PIPE, FIELD VERIFY THE EXISTING PIPE WEIGHT.  SERVICE WEIGHT MATERIALS MAY BE USED FOR MINOR REPAIRS OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING SERVICE WEIGHT C.I. PIPE, IF IT ELIMINATES OR MINIMIZES THE NEED FOR ROMAC COUPLINGS TO TRANSITION FROM XH TO SERVICE WEIGHT.

ALL LINES ROUTED ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE LOCATED 10 FEET OR MORE FROM POTABLE WATER LINES. DEPT. OF HEALTH REQUIREMENTS MUST BE FOLLOWED IF SPACING IS LESS THAN 5 FEET. ",1.

","CHEMICAL CLEANING PROCEDURE FOR CARBON STEEL AND LOW ALLOY VALVES TO 9CR  1. DISASSEMBLE AND INSPECT THE VALVE INITIALLY SO THAT IT CAN BE DIPPED AND ALL OF THE CLEANING SOLUTIONS REMOVED ENTIRELY, ALSO ANY VISIBLE DIRT/ GREASE SHOULD BE SWABBED OUT WITH A CLEANING RAG AT THIS TIME.  2. PLACE THE VALVE PIECES IN THE CLEANING CABINET IN THE MACHINE SHOP FOR DEGREASING ITEMS. THEY SHOULD BE CYCLED THROUGH THE CLEANING MACHINE WITH A SOAP OR DETERGENT ADDED. AT THE END OF THE CYCLE, THE VALVE SHOULD BE CLEAN SO THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE OF ANY OIL WHEN USING WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATION AND WITHOUT MAGNIFICATION WITH 20/20 VISION. IF THE VALVE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAN, REPEAT THE CYCLE. AFTER THE SOAP CYCLE, RINSE ALL PARTS WITH CLEAN HOT WATER OR AS HOT CONDENSATE AND THEN QUICKLY DRY WITH AIR THAT HAS NO OIL ADDITION SUCH AS BREATHING AIR OR NITROGEN. ANY TRACES OF OIL RESIDUE THAT ARE NOT REMOVABLE THIS WAY NEED TO BE REMOVED WITH A PRODUCT SUCH AS CRC ELECTRAKLEEN. MAKE CERTAIN THE ARTICLE IS DRY AND IT SHOULD BE READY TO INSTALL. IF THERE IS RUST PROCEED TO STEP 3.  3. A SOLUTION OF EITHER 10 VOL % HYDROCHLORIC ACID OR 10 WT% CITRIC ACID SHALL BE MADE UP (1 GALLON ACID TO 9 GALLONS OF WATER FOR THE HCL OR 10 POUNDS OF CITRIC ACID TO 90 POUNDS OF WATER). ALSO, PREPARE INHIBITOR SOLUTION CONSISTING OF 1/2 PINT OF RODINE 95 TO THE APPROX 10 GALLONS OF SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE MADE UP WITH 140F WATER IF HCL IS USED OR 170F WATER IF CITRIC ACID IS USED. USE A PLASTIC CONTAINER THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND ABLE TO MIX AND HANDLE THESE SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS A PLASTIC BARREL OF HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE.  4. SOAK THE VALVE IN THE SOLUTION FOR 2-3 HOURS, REMOVE AND RINSE OFF TO CHECK FOR CLEAN. IF IT IS NOT CLEAN, MAKE NEW SOLUTION AND RESOAK. WHEN FINALLY CLEAN, PROCEED TO NEUTRALIZATION STEP 5.  5. USE ANOTHER CONTAINER TO PUT IN 100 POUNDS OR 10 GALLONS OF 160F WATER AND ADD 1-1.5 POUNDS OF SODA ASH, MIX THIS SOLUTION AND THEN SOAK THE VALVE IN THIS FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. REMOVE AND RINSE WITH CONDENSATE OR HOT WATER, THEN DRY WITH CLEAN BREATHING AIR AND PLACE THE VALVE IN A BAG WITH DESSICANT OR DRY PLACE SO NO FLASH RUST OCCURS UNTIL USE.  "

IF THE VALVE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAN, REPEAT THE CYCLE. AFTER THE SOAP CYCLE, RINSE ALL PARTS WITH CLEAN HOT WATER OR AS HOT CONDENSATE AND THEN QUICKLY DRY WITH AIR THAT HAS NO OIL ADDITION SUCH AS BREATHING AIR OR NITROGEN.

USE A PLASTIC CONTAINER THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND ABLE TO MIX AND HANDLE THESE SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS A PLASTIC BARREL OF HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE.  4. SOAK THE VALVE IN THE SOLUTION FOR 2-3 HOURS, REMOVE AND RINSE OFF TO CHECK FOR CLEAN. IF IT IS NOT CLEAN, MAKE NEW SOLUTION AND RESOAK. WHEN FINALLY CLEAN, PROCEED TO NEUTRALIZATION STEP 5.  5. USE ANOTHER CONTAINER TO PUT IN 100 POUNDS OR 10 GALLONS OF 160F WATER AND ADD 1-1.5 POUNDS OF SODA ASH, MIX THIS SOLUTION AND THEN SOAK THE VALVE IN THIS FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR.

PLACE THE VALVE PIECES IN THE CLEANING CABINET IN THE MACHINE SHOP FOR DEGREASING ITEMS. THEY SHOULD BE CYCLED THROUGH THE CLEANING MACHINE WITH A SOAP OR DETERGENT ADDED. AT THE END OF THE CYCLE, THE VALVE SHOULD BE CLEAN SO THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE OF ANY OIL WHEN USING WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATION AND WITHOUT MAGNIFICATION WITH 20/20 VISION. IF THE VALVE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAN, REPEAT THE CYCLE. AFTER THE SOAP CYCLE, RINSE ALL PARTS WITH CLEAN HOT WATER OR AS HOT CONDENSATE AND THEN QUICKLY DRY WITH AIR THAT HAS NO OIL ADDITION SUCH AS BREATHING AIR OR NITROGEN. ANY TRACES OF OIL RESIDUE THAT ARE NOT REMOVABLE THIS WAY NEED TO BE REMOVED WITH A PRODUCT SUCH AS CRC ELECTRAKLEEN. MAKE CERTAIN THE ARTICLE IS DRY AND IT SHOULD BE READY TO INSTALL.

A SOLUTION OF EITHER 10 VOL % HYDROCHLORIC ACID OR 10 WT% CITRIC ACID SHALL BE MADE UP (1 GALLON ACID TO 9 GALLONS OF WATER FOR THE HCL OR 10 POUNDS OF CITRIC ACID TO 90 POUNDS OF WATER). ALSO, PREPARE INHIBITOR SOLUTION CONSISTING OF 1/2 PINT OF RODINE 95 TO THE APPROX 10 GALLONS OF SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE MADE UP WITH 140F WATER IF HCL IS USED OR 170F WATER IF CITRIC ACID IS USED. USE A PLASTIC CONTAINER THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND ABLE TO MIX AND HANDLE THESE SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS A PLASTIC BARREL OF HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE.  4. SOAK THE VALVE IN THE SOLUTION FOR 2-3 HOURS, REMOVE AND RINSE OFF TO CHECK FOR CLEAN. IF IT IS NOT CLEAN, MAKE NEW SOLUTION AND RESOAK. WHEN FINALLY CLEAN, PROCEED TO NEUTRALIZATION STEP 5.  5. USE ANOTHER CONTAINER TO PUT IN 100 POUNDS OR 10 GALLONS OF 160F WATER AND ADD 1-1.5 POUNDS OF SODA ASH, MIX THIS SOLUTION AND THEN SOAK THE VALVE IN THIS FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR.
