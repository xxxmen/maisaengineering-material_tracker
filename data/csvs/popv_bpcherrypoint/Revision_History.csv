DISASSEMBLE AND INSPECT THE VALVE INITIALLY SO THAT IT CAN BE DIPPED AND ALL OF THE CLEANING SOLUTIONS REMOVED ENTIRELY, ALSO ANY VISIBLE DIRT/ GREASE SHOULD BE SWABBED OUT WITH A CLEANING RAG AT THIS TIME.  2. PLACE THE VALVE PIECES IN THE CLEANING CABINET IN THE MACHINE SHOP FOR DEGREASING ITEMS. THEY SHOULD BE CYCLED THROUGH THE CLEANING MACHINE WITH A SOAP OR DETERGENT ADDED. AT THE END OF THE CYCLE, THE VALVE SHOULD BE CLEAN SO THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE OF ANY OIL WHEN USING WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATION AND WITHOUT MAGNIFICATION WITH 20/20 VISION. IF THE VALVE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAN, REPEAT THE CYCLE. AFTER THE SOAP CYCLE, RINSE ALL PARTS WITH CLEAN HOT WATER OR AS HOT CONDENSATE AND THEN QUICKLY DRY WITH AIR THAT HAS NO OIL ADDITION SUCH AS BREATHING AIR OR NITROGEN. ANY TRACES OF OIL RESIDUE THAT ARE NOT REMOVABLE THIS WAY NEED TO BE REMOVED WITH A PRODUCT SUCH AS CRC ELECTRAKLEEN. MAKE CERTAIN THE ARTICLE IS DRY AND IT SHOULD BE READY TO INSTALL. IF THERE IS RUST PROCEED TO STEP 3.  3. A SOLUTION OF EITHER 10 VOL % HYDROCHLORIC ACID OR 10 WT% CITRIC ACID SHALL BE MADE UP (1 GALLON ACID TO 9 GALLONS OF WATER FOR THE HCL OR 10 POUNDS OF CITRIC ACID TO 90 POUNDS OF WATER). ALSO, PREPARE INHIBITOR SOLUTION CONSISTING OF 1/2 PINT OF RODINE 95 TO THE APPROX 10 GALLONS OF SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE MADE UP WITH 140F WATER IF HCL IS USED OR 170F WATER IF CITRIC ACID IS USED. USE A PLASTIC CONTAINER THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND ABLE TO MIX AND HANDLE THESE SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS A PLASTIC BARREL OF HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE.  4. SOAK THE VALVE IN THE SOLUTION FOR 2-3 HOURS, REMOVE AND RINSE OFF TO CHECK FOR CLEAN. IF IT IS NOT CLEAN, MAKE NEW SOLUTION AND RESOAK. WHEN FINALLY CLEAN, PROCEED TO NEUTRALIZATION STEP 5.  5. USE ANOTHER CONTAINER TO PUT IN 100 POUNDS OR 10 GALLONS OF 160F WATER AND ADD 1-1.5 POUNDS OF SODA ASH, MIX THIS SOLUTION AND THEN SOAK THE VALVE IN THIS FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR.

DAI ,20080421,,"ADDED THE FOLLOWING NOTES:  CHEMICAL CLEANING PROCEDURE FOR CARBON STEEL AND LOW ALLOY VALVES TO 9CR  1. DISASSEMBLE AND INSPECT THE VALVE INITIALLY SO THAT IT CAN BE DIPPED AND ALL OF THE CLEANING SOLUTIONS REMOVED ENTIRELY, ALSO ANY VISIBLE DIRT/ GREASE SHOULD BE SWABBED OUT WITH A CLEANING RAG AT THIS TIME.  2. PLACE THE VALVE PIECES IN THE CLEANING CABINET IN THE MACHINE SHOP FOR DEGREASING ITEMS. THEY SHOULD BE CYCLED THROUGH THE CLEANING MACHINE WITH A SOAP OR DETERGENT ADDED. AT THE END OF THE CYCLE, THE VALVE SHOULD BE CLEAN SO THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUE OF ANY OIL WHEN USING WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATION AND WITHOUT MAGNIFICATION WITH 20/20 VISION. IF THE VALVE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAN, REPEAT THE CYCLE. AFTER THE SOAP CYCLE, RINSE ALL PARTS WITH CLEAN HOT WATER OR AS HOT CONDENSATE AND THEN QUICKLY DRY WITH AIR THAT HAS NO OIL ADDITION SUCH AS BREATHING AIR OR NITROGEN. ANY TRACES OF OIL RESIDUE THAT ARE NOT REMOVABLE THIS WAY NEED TO BE REMOVED WITH A PRODUCT SUCH AS CRC ELECTRAKLEEN. MAKE CERTAIN THE ARTICLE IS DRY AND IT SHOULD BE READY TO INSTALL. IF THERE IS RUST PROCEED TO STEP 3.  3. A SOLUTION OF EITHER 10 VOL % HYDROCHLORIC ACID OR 10 WT% CITRIC ACID SHALL BE MADE UP (1 GALLON ACID TO 9 GALLONS OF WATER FOR THE HCL OR 10 POUNDS OF CITRIC ACID TO 90 POUNDS OF WATER). ALSO, PREPARE INHIBITOR SOLUTION CONSISTING OF 1/2 PINT OF RODINE 95 TO THE APPROX 10 GALLONS OF SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE MADE UP WITH 140F WATER IF HCL IS USED OR 170F WATER IF CITRIC ACID IS USED. USE A PLASTIC CONTAINER THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG AND ABLE TO MIX AND HANDLE THESE SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS A PLASTIC BARREL OF HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE.  4. SOAK THE VALVE IN THE SOLUTION FOR 2-3 HOURS, REMOVE AND RINSE OFF TO CHECK FOR CLEAN. IF IT IS NOT CLEAN, MAKE NEW SOLUTION AND RESOAK. WHEN FINALLY CLEAN, PROCEED TO NEUTRALIZATION STEP 5.  5. USE ANOTHER CONTAINER TO PUT IN 100 POUNDS OR 10 GALLONS OF 160F WATER AND ADD 1-1.5 POUNDS OF SODA ASH, MIX THIS SOLUTION AND THEN SOAK THE VALVE IN THIS FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR. REMOVE AND RINSE WITH CONDENSATE OR HOT WATER, THEN DRY WITH CLEAN BREATHING AIR AND PLACE THE VALVE IN A BAG WITH DESSICANT OR DRY PLACE SO NO FLASH RUST OCCURS UNTIL USE. ",LOOMT0  ,2008-4-21
