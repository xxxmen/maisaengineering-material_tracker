This is far from covering everything, but to those programmers who will develop
after me, and for my reference as well, here it goes!

1	Admin
	1.1 	Messaging

2	POPV
	2.1		Roles
	
================================================================================	
1. 	Admin

	Currently this namespace is used only for Maintenance messages. I just added it on,
	since the namespacing has worked well in other projects to divide between admin
	stuff and general user stuff. We currently do not have a ROLE for super admins
	(aka. Telaeris personnel only), so the BP admins have all the same rights as us.
	BUT, they do not know of the /admin route, so I think it should be fine. 
	Reengineering the roles on this site would be painful and might take weeks, 
	since testing is lacking!

	1.1 	Messaging
	
		Route: 			/admin/new_message
		Controller: 	Admin::MessagesController
		Model: 			Admin::Message
		
		Accessing this (for admins only) allows for you to create a new message to display
		in the header area, mainly for maintenance warnings (thats why it was created).
		Although you could do it for non-maintenance, this is the only thing we could think of 
		for now. It will display your message starting 24 hours before the set 
		deadline (you can change this in the model's TIME_TO_DISPLAY constant) until 
		the deadline. After that, it will get deleted. It will display on every page, 
		and cannot be turned off (unless the DB record is deleted in the 'admin_messages' table).
		
================================================================================	
2. 	POPV

	POPV 

	2.1 	Roles
	
		Route: 			/popv
		
		Here is a breakdown of what permissions the different roles have for the
		POPV part of the site:
		
		Permissions:
		
		1) View Access
		2) BOM Viewing
		3) BOM Create
		4) BOM Finalize
		5) BOM Copy (any BOM)
		6) BOM Supercede (any BOM)
		7) Create Material Request from BOM
		8) View the Admin Nav
		
		Roles (allowed permissions are in parentheses):
		
		1) POPV Admin 					(All)
		2) POPV enabled user 			(1,2,3,4,5,6)
		3) POPV enabled user + Buyer 	(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
		4) All Others 					(1)
