Material Tracker Considerations
===============================

	= Thinking Sphinx
	
		MUCH better than ferret! Drop ferret when you get a chance.
	
		Currently this addon to rails is a frozen plugin in vendor/plugins/thinking_sphinx.
		When migrating to Rails 2.3, we should drop it from the plugins directory and
		add it as a frozen gem (with config.gem).
		Because this is still Rails 1.2, I had to modify two lines in the thinking_sphinx's
		code for backwards compatability reasons:
		
			1) thinking_sphinx/lib/thinking_sphinx/configuration.rb: 160
				 - Commented out a line trying to access the Rails configuration.
				 - Added the Dependencies.mechanism check to get around it, since it was
				   breaking in production mode with cache_classes = true on.
				   
			2) thinking_sphinx/lib/thinking_sphinx/tasks.rb: 7
				 - Same reason as above
